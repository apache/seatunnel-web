## How to start

Notice: Some details please refer to the docs/QuickStart.md

### 1 Preparing the Apache SeaTunnel environment

#### 1.1 Install Apache SeaTunnel

If you already have Apache SeaTunnel environment, you can skip this step and go to [Install your SeaTunnel to your local maven repository](#1.2 Install your SeaTunnel to your local maven repository)

Because running SeaTunnel Web must rely on the SeaTunnel, if you do not have a SeaTunnel environment, you need to first install and deploy a SeaTunnel (hereinafter referred to as ST). You need to use the dev branch in the ST repositories.

Reference `https://github.com/apache/seatunnel` to deploy a ST

#### 1.2 Install your SeaTunnel to your local maven repository

If you already have a ST environment which is from ST github dev branch. Make sure the version is 2.3.2-SNAPSHOT in the pom file. then use command './mvnw clean install  '-Dmaven.test.skip=true' '-Dcheckstyle.skip=true'' to install ST package into your local maven repository


#### 1.3 Run SeaTunnel in RDEA

Reference `https://github.com/apache/seatunnel` 

### 2 Run SeaTunnel Web in IDEA

If you want to deploy and run SeaTunnel Web, Please turn to [3 Run SeaTunnel Web In Server](#3 Run SeaTunnel Web In Server)

#### 2.1 Init database 

1. Edit `seatunnel-server/seatunnel-app/src/main/resources/script/seatunnel_server_env.sh` file, Complete the installed database address, port, username, and password. Here is an example:
